#  Loops & Iteration in C++

## Overview

Loops allow repetition of a block of code until a condition is met.  
They are essential for solving problems efficiently and are widely used in Data Structures & Algorithms.

This chapter covers different types of loops and control statements.

##  Concepts Covered

- for Loop             : Used when the number of iterations is known.
- while Loop           : Used when the number of iterations is not fixed.
- do-while Loop        : Executes at least once, even if condition is false.
- break Statement      : Stops the loop immediately.
- continue Statement   : Skips current iteration and moves to next.
