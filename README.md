# C++ DSA Learning Journey 🚀

Hello! I'm **Hanifa Khanam**, a BS Software Engineering student with a strong interest in mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++**.

This repository documents my **step-by-step C++ DSA learning journey**, starting from programming fundamentals and progressing toward advanced problem-solving and competitive programming concepts.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- C++ Programming Fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Arrays, Strings, and Pointers
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Heaps, Maps, Sets, and Tries
- Advanced Algorithms (Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Segment Trees)
- Problem Solving for Competitive Programming and Interviews

## 🎯 Goal
To build strong **C++ and DSA fundamentals**, implement concepts through clean and efficient code, solve real-world and competitive programming problems, and become **internship-ready for software development roles**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder represents a learning phase and may include:
- Concept explanations and notes
- Practice code implementations
- Mini-projects and problem-solving exercises

## 🧠 Learning Approach
- Structured, step-by-step progression from beginner to advanced
- Strong focus on understanding core concepts
- Hands-on practice with increasing complexity
- Interview-oriented and competitive programming problem solving

🌱 This repository will continuously evolve as I learn, practice, and build real-world problem-solving skills in C++.
