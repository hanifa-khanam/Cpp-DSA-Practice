# C++ DSA Learning Journey 🚀

Hello! I'm Hanifa Khanam, a Software Engineering student with a strong interest in mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C++.

This repository documents my learning journey from programming fundamentals to advanced DSA concepts, including:
- C++ programming basics
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Arrays, Strings & Pointers
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Heaps, Maps, Sets & Tries
- Advanced Algorithms (Greedy, DP, Segment Trees)
- Problem Solving for Competitive Programming

## Goal
To build strong C++ fundamentals, implement DSA concepts in code, solve real problems, and become internship-ready in competitive programming and software development.

## Structure
Each folder represents a learning phase with:
- Practice code
- Notes & concepts
- Mini-projects / problem-solving exercises


## Learning Style
- Step-by-step, from beginner to advanced
- Concept-focused & intuitive explanations
- Practice-oriented, with small coding exercises
- Problem-solving for interviews and competitive coding

🌱 This repository will grow with my learning journey and real-world projects.
