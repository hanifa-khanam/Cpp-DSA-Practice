# 🧠 Logic Building: Flowcharts & Pseudocode

## 📌 Overview

Before writing actual C++ code, I focused on building strong logical thinking skills using Flowcharts and Pseudocode.  
This helped me understand how programs work internally before jumping into syntax.

Strong logic is the foundation of Data Structures & Algorithms.

## 🔎 What is a Flowchart?

A flowchart is a visual representation of a program’s logic using symbols.

It helps break down problems step by step.

### Common Symbols:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Oval | Start / End |
| Rectangle | Process |
| Parallelogram | Input / Output |
| Diamond | Decision |

### Example: Sum of Two Numbers

(Start)

↓

Input A, B

↓

Sum = A + B

↓

Print Sum

↓

(End)

## 📝 What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a simple, human-readable way to describe program logic before writing real code.

It is not actual C++ code — it focuses only on logic.

### Example: Sum of Two Numbers

START

INPUT A, B

SET Sum = A + B

PRINT Sum

END

## 🎯 Why This Is Important

- Improves problem-solving skills
- Makes debugging easier
- Helps in technical interviews
- Used before writing complex algorithms
- Builds foundation for recursion, trees, graphs, etc.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Breaking problems into small logical steps
- Designing solutions before coding
- Thinking like a programmer
- Converting logic into C++ programs
