# 🔢 Binary Number System in C++


The Binary Number System is the foundation of how computers store and process data.

Computers understand only two digits: 0 and 1

This chapter covers binary basics, conversions between decimal and binary, and implementation using C++.

Understanding binary is essential for memory management, bit manipulation, and optimized algorithms.

##  What is the Binary Number System?

The binary number system is a base-2 number system.

Unlike decimal (base-10), which uses digits 0–9, binary uses only: 0 and 1

Each digit in binary is called a **bit**.

## 🔄 Binary to Decimal Conversion

Example:

Binary: 1011

Step-by-step:

1 × 2³  

0 × 2²  

1 × 2¹  

1 × 2⁰  

= 8 + 0 + 2 + 1  

= 11 (decimal)

## 🔄 Decimal to Binary Conversion

Example:

Decimal: 13

Divide repeatedly by 2:

13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1  

6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0  

3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1  

1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1  

Read remainders from bottom to top:

1101
