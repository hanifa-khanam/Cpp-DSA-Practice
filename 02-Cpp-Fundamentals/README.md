#  C++ Fundamentals

##  Overview

This chapter covers the foundational concepts required to start programming in C++.  
It explains how C++ programs are structured, how code executes, and how data is stored and handled.

These fundamentals are essential before moving to Data Structures & Algorithms.

##  What is a Variable?

A variable is a container that stores data in memory.

Think of it like a labeled box:

Age → 20  
Name → Hanifa  
Marks → 85.5  

Each variable:
- Has a name
- Stores a value
- Occupies memory space

## What is a Data Type?

A Data Type defines:
- What kind of data can be stored
- How much memory it takes
- What operations can be performed

##  Common Data Types in C++

| Data Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| int | Integer numbers | 10 |
| float | Decimal numbers | 3.14 |
| double | Larger decimal numbers | 99.999 |
| char | Single character | 'A' |
| bool | True/False | true |
| string | Text | "Hello" |
