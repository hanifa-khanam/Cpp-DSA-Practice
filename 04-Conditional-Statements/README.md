# Chapter 4: Conditional Statements in C++

Welcome to **Chapter 4** of my C++ learning journey! This repository focuses on **Conditional Statements**, a fundamental concept in programming that allows decision-making in code.

---

## Topics Covered

- **If-Else Statements**  
  Execute code blocks based on a condition.

- **Else-If Statements**  
  Handle multiple conditions sequentially.

- **Ternary Operator (`? :`)**  
  A concise way to write simple conditional expressions.

- **Switch Statement**  
  Execute code based on multiple discrete values.

## Why This Matters

Conditional statements form the backbone of logic in programming. Mastering these allows you to:

- Control program flow effectively  
- Write efficient and readable code  
- Solve real-world problems dynamically
